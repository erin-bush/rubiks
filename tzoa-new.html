            <p>I was the team lead in charge of organizing development team and integrating individual components into a final prototype.
            I facilitated weekly meetings and reminded developers of deadlines and happily provided assistance if a task was proving to
            be more challenging than anticipated.  Having a positive team environment was a high priority to me as team lead.
            I approached all situations with empathy, and worked with all team members to isolate any issues and tackle them as a team.</p>
