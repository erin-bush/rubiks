                At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, 
                and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and 
                throwing his cereal at the walls.

              "Little tyke," chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive.
              It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map.

                There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet

                  Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought 
                  of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.

                But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help
                noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people
                about.
