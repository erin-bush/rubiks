    <p class="personal-description">
      Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, 
      thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or 
      mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense. Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man 
      with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. 
    </p>
    <p class="personal-description">
      Other interests include: flying on brooms, talking to snakes, hanging out with my friends Ron and Hermione.</p>

    <p class="work-item-description">The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer 
      boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that
      somebody would discover it.

      They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;
      in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her
      sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be.

      The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the
      Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; 
      they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.
